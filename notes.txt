First 2 pages has only 8 lines
Other pages has 15 lines

All pages has one additional line (virtual line to know what is the end of last line)

Line data is array as you see,
   if its length is 1 only like [1] it represents the surah name header.
   if its length is 2 only like [2,0] it represents basmallah.
   if its length is 3 it represents normal line like [1,1,0]   - [surah_no, ayah_no, 0_based_word_index]

 so [1] means surah name header for al fatiha
 [2,0] means basmallah for surah al baqarah
 [2,1,0] means first line of al baqarah which starts with ayah 1 with word index 0
